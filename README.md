# 5.4 TODO React App

## Features
- Add new task
- Click on task to mark it complete 

## Elements
Task
- Textbox
- Buttons
	- Create new task
		- Delete
		- Add
	- Edit existing task
		- Complete
		- Delete
List
- Tasks

### Instructions

This week you will create a React app for practice. This is NOT your final project but is intended to just be a practice run as some concepts.  Here are the features of the app you will create:

-   Basic TODO list functionality
	- Add new task
	- Click on task to mark it complete
-   Here are the elements needed
    -   Textbox to enter new task
    -   Button to add task to list
    -   List with elements that you can click on to mark completed
-   Clean style with CSS

There is no database backend. This app should be 100% in the browser and should not refresh the screen or submit to any server.  It's purely an in-browser app.  

When done, check this into your repo for Course Work (**NOT** YOUR FINAL PROJECT REPO). When you are ready, submit the URL and commit hash you want me to look at as well as the name of the folder your todo project is in when I do a pull.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
